Originally started with 16X16 solver from a university project. Written in very C style Cpp.

Have changed back to a 9X9 solver and tried use more Cpp style code.

Using a recurisve algorithm, will solve a sodoku from a given input file in the following format:

X2X8XXXXX
9X1XXXXXX
X7X246XXX
2X9XX5XX4
XX5X8XX6X
XXXX61XXX
XXXXXXX57
3XXXXX8XX
XXX327XXX
